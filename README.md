# Hand Programming  Language Challenge

Please find my version associated to publised challenge by Jesus Seijas.


## This is a published test associated with Hand moving on a mirror
## Demo

You find a strange mirror that always shows a hand that is moving. The hand appears to be alive, and after a lot of questions of "yes" and "no" answer, you know that the hand is trying to teach you a program that is written in HPL (Hand Programming Language).

This language works with a memory of an indefinite size of bytes, with all values initialized to 0. This language haves 7 instructions:

ğŸ‘‰ : moves the memory pointer to the next cell

ğŸ‘ˆ : moves the memory pointer to the previous cell

ğŸ‘† : increment the memory cell at the current position

ğŸ‘‡ : decreases the memory cell at the current position.

ğŸ¤œ : if the memory cell at the current position is 0, jump just after the corresponding ğŸ¤›

ğŸ¤› : if the memory cell at the current position is not 0, jump just after the corresponding ğŸ¤œ

ğŸ‘Š : Display the current character represented by the ASCII code defined by the current position.


## Notes
As memory cells are bytes, from 0 to 255 value, if you decrease 0 you'll get 255, if you increment 255 you'll get 0.
Loops of ğŸ¤œ and ğŸ¤› can be nested.

## Tests
The hand shows you two small programs and their outputs:

This program display "Hello"

This program (with nested loops) display "Hello World!"
